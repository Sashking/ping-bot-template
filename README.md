## Tips on how to run the bot consistently
- The more channels and categories you create - the smaller the cooldown can be
- Don't go nuts with the speeds, it's better to create a second bot rather then maxing out the speed on the first one
- If you plan on running the bots on your own PC, make sure you aren't even close to the rate limit (otherwise Discord might temporarily ban your IP for 0.5-2 hours)
